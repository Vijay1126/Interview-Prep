 Points to Note:
 1. There are a few ways to do this, a) Sort both the arrays and see if they are equal.Keep in mind this is an anagram and
 *not* a subset. So the same letters will be present just in a different order. 
 2. If we were to have unicode characters, the length of the sorted array could be huge, therefore the ideal thing 
 to do here to do is to use a hash map, like I did
