from collections import Counter

class Solution:
    def firstUniqChar(self, s: str) -> int:
        dict = {}
  
        count = collections.Counter(s)
        
        for index, value in enumerate(s):
            if(count[value]==1):
                return index
        
        return -1
       


Points to Note:
1. Think of when to import collections
2. Order of how it is hashed does not matter, iterate through the original array/list/string and find the value in the dictionary 
3. from collections import Counter
