class Solution:
    def reverseBits(self, n: int) -> int:
        push = 31
        rev = 0
        
        for i in range(32): 
            rev+=(n&1)<<push-i
            print(rev)
            n = n>>1
        return rev
    
   
  Points:
  
  To find out what the last element is : and it with 1 (n&1), similarly 11, 111 will yield the last bits.
  
  If you want to say, count the number of 1's in n , (n-1)&n will remove the last 1 present in n. By keeping a counter and 
  checking if n exits, we can get the job done.
